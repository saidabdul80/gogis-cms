# About us:
The Gombe Geographic Information System (GOGIS) is the agency responsible for digitalized land administration, cadastral mapping, and land registration in Gombe State, Nigeria. 
It was established to modernize land governance, resolve land conflicts, and improve revenue generation for the state government.

# Key Functions and Objectives
GOGIS operates as a national model for digital land administration in Nigeria. Its core business functions and objectives include: 
1.⁠ ⁠Land Administration: Managing the process of determining, recording, and disseminating information about land acquisition, ownership, value, and management policies.
2.⁠ ⁠Conflict Resolution: Putting an end to land conflicts often caused by unauthorized transactions, thereby ensuring peace and economic stability.
3.⁠ ⁠Digitalization and Mapping: Transitioning from manual archiving of land documents to a fully automated and secure digital system, including the digitization of manual land files and layouts.
4.⁠ ⁠Title Registration and Issuance: Processing and issuing formal land titles, such as Rights of Occupancy (RofO) and Certificates of Occupancy (CofO), with processes aiming for completion within specific timelines (two weeks for RofO, thirty working days for CofO).
5.⁠ ⁠Revenue Generation: Contributing significantly to the state's Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) through efficient and transparent land transactions and property taxation.
6.⁠ ⁠Urban Planning and Development: Supporting planned, sustainable urban development initiatives such as the Gombe Capital Special Development Zone and the Shehu Abubakar District.
